                        <p>After graduating from UC Davis with a bachelor's in Economics, I worked in finance and soon realized I needed more creativity in my work. I was then exposed to coding and realized I found my niche. I love the way it allows me to organize large amounts of information in my head, and I love the way it challenges me every day.</p>
                        <p>I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>'s coding bootcamp and have been looking to work for a fun and exciting company to continue my endless growth as a software developer.</p>
